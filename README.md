# Bookmark
Bookmark and navigate to locations on your Spigot server.

Commands:

- `/bm set <name>`: create a new bookmark
- `/bm del <name>`: delete a bookmark
- `/bm [list|ls]`: show all bookmarks
- `/bm nav <name>`: navigate to a location
- `/bm [clear|clr]`: clear navigation

This plugin will also automatically remember the last place that you died, set it as the bookmark `rip`, and allow you to navigate back.
